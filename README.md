# Advent of Code

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is a yearly event where every day in December, up until Christmas day, a code puzzle is posted and you try to solve it.

## This Repository

This Repo is just where I keep all of my solutions to the problems. You can look at my them if you want and copy the solutions, I don't really care lol. You will not understand the code unless you check that problem's prompt.

## Go Play the Game!

Go to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and play this yourself! You can do all past events and, the best part, it's free!
